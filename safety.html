  <h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>
  <p>
    First Impressions is committed to protecting children and preventing the spread of 
    child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Our app is intended for adult use only, 
    and we actively prohibit the creation, distribution, or promotion of CSAM in any form. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If users encounter child exploitation or abuse within our app, they are required to 
    report it immediately using the in-app reporting feature. Reports are reviewed promptly, 
    and any accounts violating this policy will be removed and reported to the appropriate 
    authorities.
  </p>
  <p>
    First Impressions complies with all applicable child protection and safety laws, 
    and works with regional and national authorities where necessary. We maintain a 
    zero-tolerance policy for CSAM and ensure compliance with Google Playâ€™s 
    <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888389">child safety standards</a>.
